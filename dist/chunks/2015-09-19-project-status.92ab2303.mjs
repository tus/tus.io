Our project\nlead [Marius Kleidl](https://github.com/Acconut) has been taking care\nof integrating a large batch of improvements\nthat were made by Vimeo's [Naren Venkataraman](https://github.com/vayam) and this team.\n\nThings still left to do:\n\n- [Write a Developers Guide](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/issues/59)\n- Gather a _final round of feedback_ on [the 1.0 proposal](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/pull/57)\n\nWe're waiting for a _final round of feedback_ to make sure every last bit\nis taken care of before cementing everything into our first stable release.\n\n### Exposure & Swag\n\nTo make sure every developer and interested party had their change to chime in,\nwe're trying to get some extra exposure for the project. We'll be covered\nin the upcoming [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) and Transloadit\nis sponsoring conferences to hand out swag and raise tus awareness.\n\nSwag is also for sale at the new [Transloadit shop](https://shop.transloadit.com/). The shop\ncurrently features a variety of Transloadit, Uppy and Tus products and we're working with [Printful](https://www.theprintful.com/) to improve on that.\nKnow that any profit flows back to the project and our books are open to\nanyone who wants to verify.\n\n### Implementations\n\nWhile 1.0 could potentially still be changed, we don't expect major changes\nso our official implementations have already been made 1.0 compatible.\n\nAll official projects have been updated to the 1.0 branch already\nfor which a big thank you goes out to [Mark R. Masterson](https://github.com/MMasterson)\nand Marius who upgraded all of our implementations.\n\nMarius also added Android and\nstandalone Java implementations as official tus projects, and replaced our jQuery\nimplementation with a standalone [tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client).\n\nIf you're interested in building & maintaining new 1.0 implementations, becoming\na member of tus core, leave a note here:\n\n- [More 1.0 implementations](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/issues/67)\n\n### Design\n\nThe whole site has been given a new layout by [Fahad Ibnay Heylaal](https://github.com/fahad19) and\na completely new logo was designed by [Milan Vuckovic](https://twitter.com/milan_vuckovic).\n\nWe're currently working on improving other:\n\n- [Design issues](https://github.com/tus/tus.io/issues)\n\n### Demo\n\nSince the first publication of the tus protocol, our website featured a\n[demo page](/demo.html) allowing users to see a tus in action, interactively.\nIn the past this service had some issues with reliability and browser-support.\nBecause of this past, we updated the entire stack used by the demo.\n\nIt now uses our newly created [tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client)\nand we've updated the demo page to feature all the browsers & platforms the\nclient has been tested to work on.\nThe demo page uploads files to a [tusd 1.0](https://github.com/tus/tusd)\nserver written in Go, that we deploy via the newly created\ninfra-tusd repository.\n\n### Infra\n\nStill a work in progress, infra-tusd\nuses a powerful combination of [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) and\n[Terraform](https://terraform.io/) to\nspin up fully functioning tus servers with a single command. Every bit\n(except for the AWS & SSH keys) has been added to the repository\nand is publicly available.\n\nPlease reach out if you'd like to help us:\n\n- Add local Vagrant support for testing the Ansible scripts\n\n### Adoption\n\nFinally, a few big companies have taken an interest\nin tus. tus will always remain open source and community owned, but\nwe're excited that we're on the path to realizing our mission to\nchange how the world does file uploading.\n\nWe'll have more announcements on this soon!\n\nIf you (plan to) use tus in production, please comment on this issue and get your\ncompany listed on the tus.io website:\n\n- [Companies that (plan to) use tus](https://github.com/tus/tus.io/issues/28)\n";
