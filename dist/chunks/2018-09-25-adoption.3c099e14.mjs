The 'tus' community on GitHub continues to thrive and we're seeing issues raised and addressed on a daily basis. You guys are awesome!\n\nTus was also featured in a magazine: Streaming Media. Since they were asking for supporting graphic material, we asked our designer [Alexander Zaytsev](https://twitter.com/nqst) to explain the Concat Extension in a visual way, and he came up with the following:\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%\" src=\"/assets/img/concat.jpeg\">\n\nWe thought it was really cool, but we also wanted to share it and hear what _you_ think!\n\nAll the best from the team at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) and see you on GitHub or the forum!\n";
