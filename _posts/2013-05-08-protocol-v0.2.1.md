This is a minor protocol release:

<!--more-->

* Fix [#19](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/pull/19):
  Final-Length header was called Final-Size in one place by accident. ([Naren
  Venkataraman](https://github.com/vayam))
* Define that PATCH requests MUST use `application/offset+octet-stream` as the
  `Content-Type`. ([Felix Geisendörfer](https://github.com/felixge))
* Define that `Final-Length` values MUST NOT be negative. ([Felix
  Geisendörfer](https://github.com/felixge))

All patches can be seen [here](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/compare/v0.2...v0.2.1).
