More than a year ago the last release, `0.2.2` was published. Now the final 1.0
release is just around the corner introducing breaking changes and a lot of new
features.

<!--more-->

The major changes towards the core include the addition of the `TUS-Resumable`,
`TUS-Max-Size`, `TUS-Extension` and `TUS-Version` headers while making the first
one mandatory. All these headers must be returned in the new `OPTIONS` request
in order to enable protocol discovery. In addition the `Offset` header must not
be greater or lower than the current offset for the file.

The biggest changes were made by introducing the Upload-Expiration, Checksum,
Stream, Retries, Termination, Merge and Metadata extensions.

After all of this work the protocol is now considered stable and ready for use
in production environments. Speaking of implementations the official
`tus-jquery-client` and
`tusd` repositories are currently being
updated to support the 1.0 release.

The final 1.0 Release will be published by merging the
[according pull request](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/pull/57)
on GitHub once these changes are done. Furthermore, last feedback may be
submitted there to adjust minor things.
