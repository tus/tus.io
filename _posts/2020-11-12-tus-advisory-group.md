Since the tus project has been started in 2013, many contributors with various technical backgrounds have joined our mission and helped move the protocol forward. Some people have contributed their knowledge as front-end developers, server engineers, security professionals, network administrator and many more to tus. This variety is of great importance as it allows looking at problems from different angles and find the optimal solution for everyone involved. Furthermore, since we want the tus protocol to be available and usable for many applications, it's essential to get feedback from as many people as possible.

To ensure that we do not lose this variety and to avoid living in our own technical bubble, we have formed the **tus Advisory Group**. Our approach has always been that important decisions about the future of the project must always have inputs from multiple people with different backgrounds, since these decisions have the potential to impact many applications and organizations. Questions and proposals must be discussed in the open, so everyone willing to join can take part in the conversation.

That's where the tus Advisory Group comes into play! It consists of contributors from the community who would like be more engaged with the protocol and shape its further development. The group's members will discuss fundamental questions about the direction that tus should take in the future. Of course, all of those conversations will always be open and available for everyone to join! The Advisory Group is not a closed circle but instead a formation that will be invited to all major discussions regarding tus.

As of the writing of this post, the group consists of [Stefan Matsson](https://github.com/smatsson), the person behind [tusdotnet](https://github.com/tusdotnet/tusdotnet), [Nils Goroll](https://github.com/nigoroll), who we can thank for the [tus Varnish Cache module](https://code.uplex.de/uplex-varnish/libvmod-tus), and [Marius Kleidl](https://github.com/Acconut), who currently leads the tus project. We hope that by forming this group, we can keep our high level of variety and ensure further development of the tus project!
