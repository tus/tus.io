Just a quick update from the team!
 
We had a fun month as we learned that [Git LFS supports our protocol for transmitting large files](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/man/git-lfs-config.5.ronn#transfer-upload--download-settings), and Clouflare uses it to power the uploading component of their [new streaming product](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-streams/). The 'tus' community on GitHub continues to thrive and we're seeing issues raised and addressed on a daily basis. You guys are awesome!

Tus was also featured in a magazine: Streaming Media. Since they were asking for supporting graphic material, we asked our designer [Alexander Zaytsev](https://twitter.com/nqst) to explain the Concat Extension in a visual way, and he came up with the following:

We thought it was really cool, but we also wanted to share it and hear what _you_ think!

All the best from the team at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) and see you on GitHub or the forum!
