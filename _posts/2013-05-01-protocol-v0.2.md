After releasing our first draft a few weeks ago, we received an incredible
amount of feedback and suggestions. Based on this feedback as well as
[discussing](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013AprJun/0155.html)
the problems with the [IETF HTTPbis Working Group](http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/wiki), we identified a few
key issues with [v0.1](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol/blob/v0.1/README.md) of the
protocol:

* `PUT` requests are not appropiate for transfering partial resources
* The `Content-Range` and `Range` headers are not meant for resuming an
  interrupted resource transfer.

After lots of careful thinking, we came up with a new approach that uses:

<!--more-->

* `PATCH` instead of `PUT`
* A new `Offset` header used by `HEAD` responses and `PATCH` requests alike
* A `Final-Length` header to provide the final file size to the server

We also split the protocol into a core protocol which takes care of
resumability, and nothing else, as well as optional protocol extensions.

The result of this has just been published as v0.2 can be seen on the [protocol
page](/protocols/resumable-upload.html). Also included is a new [FAQ
section](/protocols/resumable-upload.html#7) which will expanded over time.

We feel that the overall result is a drastic simplification of the problem down
to its essence, and we encourage interested developers to implement prototypes.

Our next step is upgrading tusd, the jquery client and the ios client to the
new protocol version. Once the protocol has reached a little more maturity, we
are also thinking about providing an executable protocol verification tool for
implementers.
