Since the tus project began in 2013, countless contributors with various
technical backgrounds have joined our mission and helped move the protocol
forward. Many people have contributed their knowledge to tus over these years,
some as front-end developers and server engineers, and others as security
professionals or network administrators. This variety is of great importance as
it allows us to look at problems from different angles and find the optimal
solution for everyone involved. Furthermore, since we want the tus protocol to
be available and usable for many applications, it's essential to get feedback
from as many people as possible.

To ensure that we do not lose this variety and to avoid living in our own
technical bubble, we have formed the **tus Advisory Group**. Our approach has
always been that important decisions about the future of the project must always
be preceded by input from multiple people with different backgrounds, since
these decisions have the potential to impact many applications and
organizations. Questions and proposals must be discussed in the open, so
everyone who is willing to take part in the conversation has the opportunity to
do so.

That's where the tus Advisory Group comes in! It consists of contributors from
the community who would like to be more engaged with the protocol and shape its
further development. The group's members will discuss fundamental questions
about the direction that tus should take in the future. Of course, all of those
conversations will always be open and available for everyone to join! The
Advisory Group is not a closed circle but instead a formation that will be
invited to weigh in on all major discussions regarding tus.

As of writing this, the group consists of:
[Stefan Matsson](https://github.com/smatsson), the person behind
[tusdotnet](https://github.com/tusdotnet/tusdotnet);
[Nils Goroll](https://github.com/nigoroll), who we can thank for the
[tus Varnish Cache module](https://code.uplex.de/uplex-varnish/libvmod-tus); and
[Marius Kleidl](https://github.com/Acconut), who currently leads the tus
project. We hope that by forming this group, we can keep our high level of
variety and ensure further development of the tus project in such a way that it
benefits as many people as possible!

If you are interested in joining the Advisory Group or want to get more involved
in the project, feel free to [reach out to us](/support.html)!
