# Resumable File Upload Demo

This demo is a working and production-ready example for resumable file uploads built using the [tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client).
It sends your files to our public [tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd) instance, which is the official reference implementation for the tus protocol, written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).

**:warning: Please be aware that the uploaded files will be removed from our servers after a few hours, for privacy, and to combat people uploading malicious content.**

### Instructions

1.  Select a large file.
2.  Watch it upload for a bit, then close this tab before it finishes.
3.  Come back to this page, select the same file again and you can resume the upload where it left off.
4.  Inspect the HTTP traffic (see below) to understand how tus works.

<UploadDemo client:load />

### HTTP Traffic

Below you can find a list of the outgoing HTTP requests and incoming responses that tus is using to upload your files:

<RequestViewer client:load />

### Compatibility

The [tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client) used in
this demo has been automatically tested and works with the following browsers:

- Microsoft Edge 12+
- Mozilla Firefox 14+
- Google Chrome 20+
- Safari 6+
- Opera 12.1+
- iOS 6.0+
- Android 5.0+

Using the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, it's possible to run tus
even on platforms that won't let you do `PUT` and `PATCH` requests.

### Source Code

The source code for this demo is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tus/tus.io/blob/main/assets/javascripts/upload-demo.js).
